GGBY Highline Gathering has been organized over the years by many amazing people who contributed their resources, time, experience, equipment, and energy towards making this magical event possible.

As of the 10th anniversary in 2017, GGBY has been an officially permitted and insured gathering coordinated and organized by Slackline U.S. and its GGBY Organizing Committee. The committee consists of a volunteer team of coordinators who give hundreds of hours throughout the year to care to the logistics of GGBY. The committee recognizes the dozens of individuals, throughout the years and currently, who volunteer, assist, or sponsor. The Gathering is a community organized event where everyone has a part in organizing.
