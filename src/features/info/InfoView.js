              GGBY stands for Gobble Gobble Bitches Yeah and first started over
              a decade ago back in 2007 during the week of Thanksgiving as an
              informal get-together of friends who wanted to highline.

              GGBY Highline Gathering has been organized over the years by many
              amazing people who contributed their resources, time, experience,
              equipment, and energy towards making this magical event possible.

            <Text style={styles.text}>
              As of the 10th anniversary in 2017, GGBY has been an officially
              permitted and insured gathering coordinated and organized by
              Slackline U.S. and its GGBY Organizing Committee. The committee
              consists of a volunteer team of coordinators who give hundreds of
              hours throughout the year to care to the logistics of GGBY. The
              committee recognizes the dozens of individuals, throughout the
              years and currently, who volunteer, assist, or sponsor. The
              Gathering is a community organized event where everyone has a part
              in organizing.

            <Text style={styles.text}>
              Slackline U.S. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that is the official
              organizer of GGBY Highline Gathering. The mission of Slackline
              U.S. is to assist in access management for the slackline
              community, encourage conservation, and foster safe practices in
              all forms of slacklining through education and community
              development. Slackline U.S. is supported by its members. In 2017,
              Slackline U.S. became the official organizer of GGBY after
              increased use in the area during Thanksgiving week became
              unsustainable and began having a hazardous impact on the local
              ecology. As a result of organizing the event, parking, camping,
              and waste management issues were better contained and conditions
              improved. The goal for future years is to continue to protect both
              access to the Fruit Bowl as well as the environment. You can
              support the mission and work of Slackline U.S. by becoming a
              member today!
