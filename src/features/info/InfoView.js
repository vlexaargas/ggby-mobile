            GGBY Highline Gathering has been organized over the years by many
            amazing people who contributed their resources, time, experience,
            equipment, and energy towards making this magical event possible.

          <Text style={styles.text}>
            As of the 10th anniversary in 2017, GGBY has been an officially
            permitted and insured gathering coordinated and organized by
            Slackline U.S. and its GGBY Organizing Committee. The committee
            consists of a volunteer team of coordinators who give hundreds of
            hours throughout the year to care to the logistics of GGBY. The
            committee recognizes the dozens of individuals, throughout the years
            and currently, who volunteer, assist, or sponsor. The Gathering is a
            community organized event where everyone has a part in organizing.

          <Text style={styles.text}>
            Slackline U.S. is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that is the official
            organizer of GGBY Highline Gathering. The mission of Slackline U.S.
            is to assist in access management for the slackline community,
            encourage conservation, and foster safe practices in all forms of
            slacklining through education and community development. Slackline
            U.S. is supported by its members. In 2017, Slackline U.S. became the
            official organizer of GGBY after increased use in the area during
            Thanksgiving week became unsustainable and began having a hazardous
            impact on the local ecology. As a result of organizing the event,
            parking, camping, and waste management issues were better contained
            and conditions improved. The goal for future years is to continue to
            protect both access to the Fruit Bowl as well as the environment.
